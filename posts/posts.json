    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe Game Awards are the gaming community’s annual celebration of the best titles from the year. And 2020 had no shortage of great games to recognize.\r\nThere were AAA heavy hitters, indie surprise hits and quarantine party games that kept us playing all year. In fact, with so many of us stuck at home for most of the year, games may have played a bigger role in entertainment than ever before.\r\n2020 was also no stranger to controversy in the gaming world. Whether it was disastrous launches or surprise lockdown favourites, there was no shortage of gaming news to get the internet talking. And a lot of gamers did that talking on the subretddit, r/Gaming.\r\nGiven there was so much to talk about during the year, did the Game Awards “Game of the Year” nominees make a splash on r/Gaming? Or were they drowned out by bigger gaming stories? We’ve taken a look at which of the nominated games got redditors talking, as well as some of the other biggest titles from the year.\r\n#6 Hades (3,913 mentions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependent developer Supergiant games’ have some experience releasing critically acclaimed titles, and their most recent outing is no slouch. Hades is a rogue-like dungeon crawler set in the world of Greek gods and myth.You play as Zagreus, the rebellious son of Hades, on a mission to escape the Underworld. The witty dialogue, fast-paced combat and… appealing characters made this a favourite among critics at the end of the year. r/Gaming users shared the enthusiasm of critics, with the conversation around the game being overwhelmingly positive. While this was the smallest discussion for any of the game awards nominees analysed, there were some key posts that drove the conversation:\r\nOne gamer’s DIY Hades -themed arcade build (Link)\r\nPraise for Clancy Brown’s performance in Hades and other titles (Link)\r\nA cartoon post entitled “Why I recommend Hades” (Link)\r\n#5 Final Fantasy 7 Remake (24,060 mentions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it was first announced in 2015, there has been a lot of hype for the Final Fantasy 7 remake. Based on the reception it received on release and over 24,000 mentions on r/Gaming, it seems this title delivered on that hype.\r\nEarly in the year, the game’s conversation was dominated by its demo (Link), and then moved to focus on disappointment at the game’s postponement. The April release date saw this conversation hit it’s peak, with a post featuring a fan’s mother recreating an NPC’s look driving mentions (Link).\r\n#4 Doom Eternal (25,113 mentions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing up from the surprise hit that was Doom 2016 was never going to be easy, but ID software seem to have done it. The Doom Slayer returns in the 5th installment to the Doom series, for one of the biggest games of 2020.\r\nReleasing as quarantines took effect around the world, the game received strong praise from gamers. Humorous content drove a decent chunk of conversation at release (Link). Another key driver of mentions was a post highlighting the effect playing Doom Eternal had on one players heart rate (Link).\r\n#3 Ghosts of Tsushima (26,952 mentions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamurai games have seen a surge in recent years, and Ghost of Tsushima is the most recent action-adventure game to opt for the setting. Sucker Punch productions, known for their work on the Infamous series, have taken that formula and crafted one of the fastest selling original titles in recent memory.\r\nUpon release, there was a conversation on r/Gaming focused on the impressive visuals of the game (Link). Discussions of historical accuracy also featured in the weeks following the launch (Link).\r\n#2 The Last of Us: Part 2 (33,113 mentions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sequel that will be remembered as one of the most controversial titles from 2020. Or maybe ever.\r\nThe Last of Us: Part 2 was a title that divided gamers and critics alike, and arguments about the game’s quality drove mentions on r/Gaming. Redditors opinions ranged from game of the year to worst game ever made, and covered everything in between.\r\nUltimately, the title was always going to be compared to its predecessor and we saw that conversation play out on the subreddit (Link).\r\nDespite the divisive discourse, it was a much happier game that topped our list as the most discussed nominee on r/Gaming.\r\n#1 Animal Crossing: New Horizons (36,305 mentions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social game that dominated quarantines and lockdowns across the globe - Animal Crossing: New Horizons was the most discussed Game of the Year nominee on r/Gaming.\r\nFor many, playing Animal Crossing represented the best way to interact with friends at a time when doing that in person wasn’t possible. Whether it was by happenstance or design, the title launched in a moment when social gaming was in high demand. And that certainly contributed to its success.\r\nBonus Round - Cyberpunk 2077, Among Us, Fall Guys, Half-Life: Alyx\r\nYou really can’t talk about the big games of 2020 without mentioning Cyberpunk 2077. Despite launching just 21 days before the year ended, there were over 210,000 mentions of the game on r/Gaming. If you want to get talked about, a bug-filled launch is one way to do it.\r\nAmong Us was another social game that rose to prominence during 2020. When everyone found themselves stuck inside, private games made for a great replacement to zoom calls (remember those?). The game was mentioned almost 45,000 times on the subreddit, hitting a peak in April.\r\nHow many of the big games this year were lockdown favourites? It may have had something to do with all the time we all spent… in lockdowns. In any case, Fall Guys launched in August and for a while, it felt like the only game anyone could talk about. And then the gaming world moved on. This was reflected on r/Gaming, where it was mentioned over 19,000 times, mainly during August and September.\r\nThe last bonus game was released in March of 2020, and represented the end of waiting for many gamers. Half-Life:Alyx may not have been the much anticipated Half-Life 2, but it certainly made an impression on gamers. The VR title drove approx. 13,000 mentions during 2020, with gifs and videos displaying the game’s physics engine dominating the conversation (Link).\r\nThe data for this blog post was sourced from Olytico - you can find out more at here.\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to know more about any aspect of this blog post, you can reach me on my Twitter account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIntroduction\r\n2020 ended up being a uniquely good year for reading (at least for me). Multiple lockdown left me with lots of reading time and for the first time I kept track of what I read during the year.\r\nI thought it would be interesting to share some of what I tracked by answering a couple of questions. Mainly, I want to see how my ratings compare to the average reader (for this, I used Goodreads average reviews). I don’t use the site myself, but its a great proxy for the general consensus on a book.\r\nThe questions I’d like to answer are as follows:\r\nHow did my ratings compare with Goodreads average ratings?\r\nWhat books did I like more than Goodreads readers?\r\nWhat books did Goodreads readers like more than me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do my ratings stack up against Goodreads?\r\nThe below graph represents the 40 books I read in 2020. Each point relates to one book, with the horizontal axis showing the Goodreads average rating and the vertical axis showing my rating. I’ve added a line to highlight the points where my rating matches the Goodreads rating (Note: You can hover over any point to see the book it relates to).\r\n \r\n\r\npreservebf7a96931195a6ba\r\n\r\nAs you can see, only 2 of 40 books had a matched rating. That said, most of the ratings were fairly close, with the majority within 0.5 of the other rating. There were a few notable exceptions, which I’ll go into more detail on below.\r\nI was surprised to see that nearly every non-fiction book I read was rated higher on Goodreads. I have a feeling this has more to do with Goodreads ratings than to do with me (did you notice that the majority of +4 star Goodreads reviewed books are non-fiction?). Maybe I just exclusively read great non-fiction?\r\nIn the next section, we’ll look at the books with the greatest difference in ratings - starting with books I liked more than Goodreads.\r\nBooks I liked more than Goodreads\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n\r\n\r\nMy.Rating\r\n\r\n\r\nGood.Reads.Rating\r\n\r\n\r\nDifference\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Memory Police\r\n\r\n\r\nYoko Ogawa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.9\r\n\r\n\r\n3.8\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Cats Disappeared From The World\r\n\r\n\r\nGenki Kawamura\r\n\r\n\r\n4.4\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7\r\n\r\n\r\n0.7\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal People\r\n\r\n\r\nSally Rooney\r\n\r\n\r\n4.5\r\n\r\n\r\n3.9\r\n\r\n\r\n0.6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Color Purple\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice Walker\r\n\r\n\r\n4.7\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2\r\n\r\n\r\n0.5\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankenstein\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Shelley\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3\r\n\r\n\r\n3.8\r\n\r\n\r\n0.5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Memory Police: This was hands down the best book I read in 2020, so I expected this to exceed the Goodreads rating. Definitely not a book for everyone, but a good pick if you enjoy allegorical fiction.\r\nIf Cats Disappeared from the World: A short read that packs an emotional punch. It starts quite lighthearted and slowly reveals itself to you. I was quite surprised that Goodreads readers didn’t like this more.\r\nNormal People: The best-selling novel that is now a major television series. This hit very close to home for me, not least because its set in the university I went to. Worth reading for the culture impact alone or as preparation for watching the TV show.\r\nThe Color Purple: Alice Walker’s Pulitzer prize winning novel is a classic for a reason. This moved me more than anything else I read this this year. I found it remarkably relevant to current day issues for a novel from the 1980’s.\r\nFrankenstein: Mary Shelley’s classic had a much lower Goodreads rating than I expected. A landmark novel that is very readable for something written over 200 years ago.\r\nBooks preferred by Goodreads readers\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n\r\n\r\nMy.Rating\r\n\r\n\r\nGood.Reads.Rating\r\n\r\n\r\nDifference\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Fires Everywhere\r\n\r\n\r\nCeleste Ng\r\n\r\n\r\n2.4\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1\r\n\r\n\r\n-1.7\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret Atwood\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4\r\n\r\n\r\n-1.4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cuckoo’s Calling\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Galbraith\r\n\r\n\r\n2.6\r\n\r\n\r\n3.9\r\n\r\n\r\n-1.3\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen All Is Said\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Griffin\r\n\r\n\r\n2.9\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\r\n\r\n\r\n-1.1\r\n\r\n\r\nSputnik Sweetheart\r\n\r\n\r\nHaruki Murakami\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n3.8\r\n\r\n\r\n-0.8\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Fires Everywhere: Another best-selling novel that is now a major television series. I think I may have had too high expectations for this. I didn’t hate this but the story just went in a direction story-wise that I didn’t enjoy.\r\nFreedom: I didn’t realise when I bought this that it’s actual a collection of excerpts from other Atwood novels. Unfortunately, I had read most of these novels before. Not an awful book, but I’d recommend just reading her actual novels instead.\r\nThe Cuckoo’s Calling: This is the first in a series of murder mystery novels from J.K. Rowling. I found it fine as a read, if a little long. Obviously Goodreads readers enjoyed it more than I did.\r\nWhen All is Said: Anne Griffin does a great job capturing life in Ireland here. I enjoyed reading this, but it was closer to a 3 than a 4 star for me.\r\nSputnik Sweetheart: I am a big Murakami fan. This was not my favorite of his, but it does have some beautiful description. If you’re interested in trying Murakami, I would probably start with something else (Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore).\r\nFinal thoughts\r\nThis was a fun little experiment in plotting my reading for 2020. As a bonus, I’ve included the number of books I read each month below. You can probably guess when college started based on how my reading fell off a cliff!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in doing something similar to this, all the graphs were created in R Markdown. The first graph utilized the Rbokeh package and the tables use the Kable extra package. This blog was compiled using the distill package and is hosted on Github pages.\r\nYou can find my other tutorials and articles here.
